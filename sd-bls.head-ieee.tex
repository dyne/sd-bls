\begin{abstract}

It is of critical importance to design digital identity systems that
ensure the privacy of citizens as well protect them from issuer
corruption. Unfortunately, what Europe's and USA's public sectors are
currently developing does not offer such basic protections. Aiming at
solving this issue, we propose a method for untraceable selective
disclosure and privacy preserving revocation of digital credentials,
utilizing the unique homomorphic characteristics of second order
Elliptic Curves and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures operated on
them. Our approach ensures that users can selectively reveal only the
necessary credentials, while protecting their privacy across multiple
presentations.  We also aim to protect users from issuer corruption,
by making it possible to apply a threshold for revocation to require
collective agreement among multiple revocation issuers.
